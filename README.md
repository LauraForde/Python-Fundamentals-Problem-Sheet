# Python Fundamentals Problem Sheet

This problem sheet is for the Emerging Technologies module in 4th year Software Development in GMIT. This module is taught by Dr. Ian McLoughlin and the origial problem sheet can be found [here](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/python-fundamentals.html).

####1. Hello, World!
This is a simple script simply printing "Hello, World!" to the console

####2. Current Time
For this exercise I had to print the current time and date to the console.

####3. FizzBuzz
This script prints the number from 1 to 100 but replaces multipes of three with "Fizz", multiples of five as "Buzz" and multiples of both as "FizzBuzz".

####4. Factorial Digit Sum
A function is required to calculate the sum of digits of the factorial of number and the sum of the digits in the number 100!

####5. Guessing Game
The user of this script must guess a secret number and if the number is wrong it will print to the console if the number is too high or too low. When the user guesses the number correctly it then prints how many guesses it took them to reach that answer.

####6. Largest and Smallest in List
This script asks the user how many numbers they will enter before asking them to enter that many numbers. When they have entered all the numbers the largest element and the smallest element are printed to the console.

####7. Palindrome Test
This is a function that tests to see if a string is a palindrome or not. 

####8.
This script asks the user how many numbers they will enter for list one and when they enter all the numbers it then does the same for list two. The lists are then merged together, sorted and then printed to the console.

####9. Newton's Method for Square Roots

####10. Reverse String
A function that takes in a string and then prints said string back to the console but in reverse.
